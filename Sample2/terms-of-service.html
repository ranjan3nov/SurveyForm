                Infosecmarketinsights MEMBERSHIP TERMS AND CONDITIONS


                Last updated: January 14, 2020

                These Terms of Use (this "Agreement") describe the terms and conditions applicable to your use of
                Lightspeed services. You should read it, understand it, and review it periodically for updates. If you
                have any questions that our Frequently Asked Questions cannot answer, please contact Support Team. If
                you do not agree to this Agreement, do not use our web site or services. We reserve the right to change,
                modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time, at our sole discretion. Your continued use
                of our site will always indicate your acceptance of this Agreement and any changes to it.



                1. Acceptance of User Agreement
                This Agreement applies to your access to, and use of, Lightspeed's web sites (the "Site") and the
                services provided by Lightspeed, including Lightspeed's Infosecmarketinsights and survey services. The Site, the
                service, and any other services Lightspeed provides are referred to in this Agreement collectively as
                the "Services"



                2. The Services
                The Services allow persons who meet eligibility requirements to take surveys or register for our user
                panel (the "Panel"). Panel members may be eligible to participate in surveys on the Site. Panel members
                may receive Points or other incentives for participation in services that Lightspeed may make available
                from time to time.



                3. Points; Active Status
                Once you have joined the Panel, Infosecmarketinsights will offer incentives in the form of points (“Points”) or
                other Infosecmarketinsights types of incentives will be awarded when you undertake various Activities on the Site,
                in line with the Infosecmarketinsights Rewards Program Terms. Points are credited to your Account only through your
                participation in Activities authorized by Lightspeed and are available for you to redeem as long as your
                Account is Active.

                When you register to the Panel, your Account will have the status “Active”, you can participate in all
                Activities you are invited to by Lightspeed and you can enjoy all Panel benefits such as access our
                Services, your incentives, and contacting Lightspeed Personnel. To keep your account “Active” means that
                you have joined the Panel and participated in a Survey or other activity on the Site within 30 days from
                your initial registration or within any 90 day period.

                Lightspeed will not provide you with any notice of the cancellation and forfeiture of any of your
                Points. Lightspeed reserves the right to amend these cancellation and forfeiture rules in its sole
                discretion.



                4. Suspension of Account; Cancellation Account
                Your Account can also be suspended if one of the following situations arises:

                No participation after you have joined the Panel
                No participation in a Survey within your first 30 days in the Panel
                No participation in a Survey within any 90-day period
                If your Account has been suspended or closed, you have the right to ask Lightspeed to investigate the
                situation. You should contact our Support team for that. If you feel your account has been incorrectly
                suspended or closed, you must contact Lightspeed by email within sixty (60) days following the alleged
                error and explain in full the basis of your dispute, attaching any relevant information which offers
                evidence of the discrepancy. Upon receipt of your notice, we will investigate your claim and notify you
                of our decision within thirty (30) days. If we need additional time to decide your claim, we will notify
                you and will endeavour to render a decision as soon as reasonably practicable. Any decision by us with
                regard to such a claim will be final.

                You may cancel your account at any time by going to our Site in your account section and click on
                “cancel my account” and your account will immediately be cancelled. If you have any issues cancelling
                your account please contact the support team. The support team will respond to you as soon as reasonably
                practicable. Immediately upon deletion or your withdrawal from the Panel, your account will be closed.
                You understand and agree that, as noted above, upon suspension, cancellation or closing of your account,
                your right to access the Services will cease and all Points credited to your account at such time,
                however and whenever accumulated, will be forfeited. Lightspeed may terminate your account at any time
                for any reason.



                5. Service Eligibility and Registration
                The Services may be used only by persons who are at least 14 years of age. The Services are not intended
                for the use of children under 14 years of age. Use of the Services is void where prohibited.



                BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
                AND WILL ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.



                6. Fees for the Services
                There is no fee for users to participate in the Services. Lightspeed may, in its sole discretion, elect
                to charge fees for participating in the Services, or to use or access any other services, at any time.
                If it does, it will update this Agreement to reflect any such changes.



                7. Participation Requirements
                Your ability to participate in the Services is expressly conditioned upon your compliance with this
                Agreement and with all policies and guidelines applicable to the Services that Lightspeed may make
                available from time to time. In the event of your noncompliance, fraud or other inappropriate activity
                (as determined by Lightspeed in its sole discretion), Lightspeed may cancel or invalidate your
                eligibility, accounts, registrations and Points, deny redemption of Points, or restrict, block, limit,
                and prevent your access to and use of the Services and, further, all Points, incentives and rewards
                shall be subject to forfeiture. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following
                requirements apply to your use of the Services:

                Non-Use and Nondisclosure. Information and content made available to you in the Services may contain
                trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information of Lightspeed's suppliers or licensors.
                You must hold in strict confidence and not disclose to any other person any information and content that
                you access or learn in connection with your participation in any survey, project, questionnaire, or
                other market research activity related to the Services. You must not use any such information or content
                for any purpose other than your participation in the Services in accordance with this Agreement. You
                hereby agree to notify Lightspeed immediately if you learn of or suspect any use or disclosure of, or
                access to, any such information or content other than as specifically authorized in this Agreement.
                Registration Information. You agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you
                as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Services; (b) maintain the security of your password
                and login credentials; and (c) maintain and promptly update your registration information and any other
                information you provide to Lightspeed, so as to keep it accurate, current and complete. Registration

                address of your primary residence, your phone number and your functioning email address.
                Multiple Accounts. You may have only one active account at any time. Only one account per mailing
                address is allowed. Multiple accounts for any person or mailing address are subject to termination and
                forfeiture of all Points, incentives and rewards.
                Compliance with Laws. You must at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and
                orders, and not cause Lightspeed to violate any laws, rules, regulations, or orders.
                Good-Faith Participation. You agree to participate in good faith and to the best of your ability in any
                market research activities in which you participate in connection with the Services. You will not
                provide false or misleading data, including without limitation, survey responses that are inconsistent
                with prior responses or statistically improbable.
                Appropriate Communications. If you communicate with our Support Team or other Lightspeed or Infosecmarketinsights
                personnel ("Personnel"), you agree to do so in a respectful and appropriate manner. You shall not send,
                upload, share or otherwise distribute to Personnel, Personnel affiliates or other users of the Services
                any rude or offensive communications or any content that is obscene, vulgar, sexually-oriented,
                shock-oriented, threatening, hateful, illegal or otherwise inappropriate.
                User Content. You may provide information to Lightspeed in connection with your participation in market
                research or otherwise in connection with the Services, including survey responses, ideas, feedback, or
                other information or content ("User Content"). If you provide any User Content, unless Lightspeed
                expressly indicates otherwise, you grant Lightspeed and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
                perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
                translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout
                the world in any media, without acknowledgement or compensation to you.


                By providing any User Content, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right to provide it,
                and that it is accurate and complete. You must not provide any User Content that:

                Is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing,

                misleading, fraudulent, or impersonates or misrepresents an affiliation with any person or entity;
                Would violate an obligation of confidentiality or the rights of any person or entity, or that would
                otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national, or international law, including,
                without limitation, the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any rules of a

                phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit card numbers;
                Contains any viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive, or destructive files or information;
                or
                In the sole judgment of Lightspeed, is objectionable, does not reflect your good faith efforts to be
                responsive to survey or market research questions, or which may expose Lightspeed or its licensors or
                suppliers to liability of any type.


                8. Copyright and Limited License

                either express or implied, to you under this Agreement. Unless explicitly stated in this Agreement,

                whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise. This license is revocable at any time.



                Any use of the Services or any Content other than as specifically authorized in this Agreement, without
                the prior written permission of Lightspeed, is strictly prohibited and will terminate the license
                granted in this section. Unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws and regulations, including,
                without limitation, copyright and trademark laws and applicable communications regulations and statutes,
                and the rights of Lightspeed and of third parties.

                endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation thereof by Lightspeed. All rights are reserved.



                10. Disclaimer of Warranties
                YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR USE OF ANY CONTENT, IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
                THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. Lightspeed, ITS
                AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, AND
                EMPLOYEES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "PROVIDERS") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS
                OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NEITHER Lightspeed NOR ANY OTHER PROVIDERS WARRANT
                UNINTERRUPTED USE, OPERATION, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT, OR THAT ANY SUBMISSION OR
                TRANSACTION REQUEST YOU ATTEMPT USING THE SERVICES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, UNCORRUPTED, OR COMPLETED WITHIN
                A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAY OR LOSS OF ANY KIND THAT
                RESULTS FROM YOUR ACCESS TO, OR USE OF, THE SERVICES AND THE CONTENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER
                ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Lightspeed OR ANY OTHER PROVIDER THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES,
                WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT. SOME
                JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM
                JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.



                11. Limitation of Liability
                NEITHER Lightspeed NOR ANY OTHER PROVIDERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
                CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
                GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF Lightspeed OR ANY OTHER PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN
                ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY
                TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
                LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
                TO YOU.



                THE MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY OF Lightspeed AND ALL OTHER PROVIDERS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS
                AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS THE GREATER OF (A) ANY AMOUNTS PAID BY Lightspeed
                TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE CLAIM, AND (B) 100 UNITED
                STATES DOLLARS ($100 USD). EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,
                DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN
                THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
                EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE
                LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.



                12. Indemnification
                You will indemnify and hold harmless Lightspeed and all other Providers from and against any costs,
                damages, expenses, and liabilities (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising
                out of or related to any User Content, your use of the Services or any Content, your violation of this
                Agreement, or your violation of any rights of a third party.



                13. Third-Party Content
                Services may contain links or references to information, content, and services provided by third parties
                (collectively, "Third-Party Content"). Lightspeed does not monitor or have any control over Third-Party
                Content. Lightspeed does not endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content and can make no guarantee as to
                its accuracy or completeness. Lightspeed undertakes no responsibility to update or review any
                Third-Party Content, and does not represent or warrant the accuracy of any information contained in any
                Third Party Content. You use any Third Party Content contained therein at your own risk. Views expressed
                in Third Party Content are not endorsed by Lightspeed.



                14. Privacy

                Please see our Privacy Policy for information regarding Lightspeed's collection, use, and disclosure of
                such information.



                15. Feedback
                You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback, original or
                creative materials, or other information or content provided by you to Lightspeed, to the extent it is
                not User Content, will become the sole property of Lightspeed. Lightspeed will own exclusive rights,
                including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and
                dissemination of such information and content for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without
                acknowledgment or compensation to you. Further, you hereby grant to Lightspeed a perpetual and
                irrevocable license to use such information and content for any purpose.



                16. Independent Contractors
                You and Lightspeed are independent contractors for all purposes. No agency, partnership, joint venture,
                employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement or by
                your access to or use of the Services.



                17. General
                Termination

                Notwithstanding any term of this Agreement, Lightspeed reserves the right, without notice and in its
                sole discretion, to discontinue or terminate any of the Services, to terminate your license to use the
                Services, to delete any Panel registrations or other accounts, to delete Points without redemption, and
                to restrict, block, limit, and prevent your access to and use of the Services. Any termination or other
                action by Lightspeed described in this paragraph will not limit any other remedies available to
                Lightspeed at law, equity or otherwise.



                Updates to this Agreement

                Lightspeed may update this Agreement from time to time. When it does, it will revise the "updated" date
                on this Agreement. You are responsible for reviewing and adhering to the most recent update of this
                Agreement.



                General Legal Notices

                By accessing or using the Services, you consent to receiving electronic communications from Lightspeed.
                These communications may include notices about your account and information concerning or related to the
                Services. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that Lightspeed
                sends to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including any requirement
                that communications be in writing.

                Lightspeed's failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive its ability to act with respect
                to that circumstance or similar circumstances. Any provision of this Agreement that is found to be
                invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable will be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of
                this Agreement will continue to be in full force and effect. The section headings and titles in this
                Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any provisions in this
                Agreement that by their nature should survive the termination of this Agreement (including, without
                limitation, provisions governing indemnification, limitations on liability, disclaimers of warranty, and
                ownership of intellectual property) will continue to remain in full force and effect after the

                This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, USA, excluding conflicts of law
                principles. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Services or this Agreement must
                be commenced within one year after the claim arose and will be settled by binding arbitration in
                accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such
                controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and will not be consolidated in any
                arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in New
                York, New York, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court of competent
                jurisdiction. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or
                review except as permitted by New York law. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive
                relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party's rights or property
                pending the completion of arbitration.

                entire agreement between you and Lightspeed concerning the Services. This Agreement supersedes all prior
