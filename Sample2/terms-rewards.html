                LIFEPOINTS REWARDS PROGRAM TERMS

                LifePoints Rewards Program Terms
                These LifePoints Rewards Program Terms ("Rules") apply to all promotions run by Lightspeed, including,
                but not limited to, the Points Program, as promoted on the LifePoints panel Site ("Site"). LifePoints
                ("LifePoints") is the name of the panel operated by Lightspeed.

                Accumulation Of LifePoints Points
                Once you have joined LifePoints, you will be offered incentives in the form of points (“Points”) or
                other LifePoints types of incentives will be awarded when you undertake various Activities on the Site.
                When you register with LifePoints, your Account will have the status “Active”, you can participate in
                all Activities you are invited to by Lightspeed and you can enjoy all LifePoints benefits such as access
                our Services, your incentives, and contacting Lightspeed Personnel. To keep your account “Active” means
                that you have joined LifePoints and participated in a survey or other activity on the Site within 30
                days from your initial registration or within any 90 day period.
                Currently, you can earn Points by completing most surveys. Where a survey does not carry Points, this
                will be clearly stated on the Site at the beginning of the survey or in the survey invitation email that
                you will receive from us.
                Your Account can also be suspended if one of the following situations arises:

                • No participation after you have joined LifePoints
                • No participation in a survey within your first 30 days from joining LifePoints
                • No participation in a survey within any 90-day period
                If your Account has been suspended or closed, you have the right to ask Lightspeed to investigate the
                situation. You should contact our support team for that. If you feel your account has been incorrectly
                suspended or closed, you must contact Lightspeed by email within sixty (60) days following the alleged
                error and explain in full the basis of your dispute, attaching any relevant information which offers
                evidence of the discrepancy. Upon receipt of your notice, we will investigate your claim and notify you
                of our decision within thirty (30) days. If we need additional time to decide your claim, we will notify
                you and will endeavour to render a decision as soon as reasonably practicable. Any decision by us with
                regard to such a claim will be final.

                Lightspeed will not provide you with any notice of the cancellation and forfeiture of any of your
                Points. Lightspeed reserves the right to amend these cancellation and forfeiture rules in its sole
                discretion.
                You may cancel your account at any time by going to our Site in your account section and click on
                “cancel my account” and your account will immediately be cancelled. If you have any issues cancelling
                your account please contact the support team. The support team will respond to you as soon as reasonably
                practicable. Immediately upon deletion or your withdrawal from LifePoints your account will be closed.
                You understand and agree that, as noted above, upon suspension, cancellation or closing of your account,
                your right to access the Services will cease and all Points credited to your account at such time,
                however and whenever accumulated, will be forfeited. Lightspeed may terminate your account at any time
                for any reason.
                Points awarded will be posted to your account no later than 30 days following survey completion and will
                be available for redemption as soon as they are posted to your account. Lightspeed takes reasonable care
                to ensure Points are accurately deposited in your account. However, you are responsible for ensuring
                that your Points are correctly deposited and you should notify Lightspeed within 2 months of completion
                of a survey if LifePoints have not been correctly posted to your account.
                LifePoints Points Values
                You will receive a certain number of LifePoints Points per completed activity (dependent on complexity).
                The number of LifePoints Points available for any activity will be stated on the Website
                You can view your total number of LifePoints Points online by visiting the Members' Page of the Website.
                LifePoints Points are personal to you and are not transferable without Lightspeed's written permission.
                They are not considered to be property, and as such, you cannot sell, transfer or assign your Points to
                any other person without Lightspeed's written permission.
                Redemption Of LifePoints Points
                You can only redeem your Points if you have enough points to redeem the lowest points amount prize on
                the Website and if your account is in good standing.
                All LifePoints Points must be redeemed online. To redeem Points, you should go to the Members' page.
                Other LifePoints redemption methods may be added or substituted in the future at Lightspeed's sole
                discretion.
                The value of one LifePoints Point varies depending on the prize you choose. Lightspeed reserves the
                right to change this value without notice, and any change will be set out on the Website or within these
                Rules.
                LifePoints Points can currently be redeemed for gift vouchers.
                The LifePoints Points can be redeemed on the Website. Further details of this arrangement can be found
                on the Website. Lightspeed reserves the right to change merchandise and gift certificate offers on the
                Website at its discretion and without notice. You acknowledge that Lightspeed is not responsible for any
                actions taken by our incentive partners in connection with the redemption of LifePoints Points.
                The value of your selected reward may not exceed the number of LifePoints Points in your account.
                However, you may select a reward of lesser value. Any unused Lightspeed Points will remain in your
                account for future use and once you redeem LifePoints Points, the appropriate number of Points will be
                deducted from your account.
                LifePoints Points are non-negotiable and may only be redeemed for the rewards stated above, or on the
                Website.
                Rewards received as a result of redemption of LifePoints Points cannot be exchanged, returned or
                redeemed for cash value.
                The rewards pictured on the Website may not necessarily reflect the exact colours or models of actual
                rewards, due to printing variations and manufacturers' updates.
                Lightspeed reserves the right to substitute any reward for a reward of equivalent or higher value if a
                reward is not available.
                Administration Of Rewards
                Lightspeed reserves the right to appoint a third party to administer its Points Program and rewards. You
                should read the Privacy Policy regarding information that will be passed to third parties in order to
                administer the Points Program and rewards.
                Lightspeed does not accept any liability for any losses suffered by you due to any error or omission by
                the third party in the administration or delivery of rewards.
                Apple is not involved in any way with the contest or sweepstakes run by Lightspeed.
