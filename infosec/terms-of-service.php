                Infosecmarketinsights MEMBERSHIP TERMS AND CONDITIONS


                Infosecmarketinsights MEMBERSHIP TERMS AND CONDITIONS Last updated: June 2\4, 2022 These Terms of Use
                (this "Agreement") describe the terms and conditions applicable to your use of Infosecmarketinsights
                services. You should read it, understand it, and review it periodically for updates. If you have any
                questions that our Frequently Asked Questions cannot answer, please contact Support Team. If you do not
                agree to this Agreement, do not use our website or services. We reserve the right to change, modify,
                add, or remove portions of this Agreement at any time, at our sole discretion. Your continued use of our
                site will always indicate your acceptance of this Agreement and any changes to it.

                1. Acceptance of User Agreement: This Agreement applies to your access to, and use of,
                Infosecmarketinsights' websites (the "Site") and the services provided by Infosecmarketinsights,
                including survey services. The Site, the service, and any other services provided by
                Infosecmarketinsights are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the "Services."

                2. The Services: The Services allow persons who meet eligibility requirements to take surveys or
                register for our user panel (the "Panel"). Panel members may be eligible to participate in surveys on
                the Site. Panel members may receive Points or other incentives for participation in services that
                Infosecmarketinsights may make available from time to time.

                3. Points; Active Status: Once you have joined the Panel, Infosecmarketinsights will offer incentives in
                the form of points ("Points") or other types of incentives will be awarded when you undertake various
                Activities on the Site, in line with the Infosecmarketinsights Rewards Program Terms. Points are
                credited to your Account only through your participation in Activities authorized by
                Infosecmarketinsights and are available for you to redeem as long as your Account is Active. When you
                register for the Panel, your Account will have the status "Active," and you can participate in all
                Activities you are invited to by Infosecmarketinsights and enjoy all Panel benefits such as access to
                our Services, your incentives, and contacting Infosecmarketinsights Personnel. To keep your account
                "Active" means that you have joined the Panel and participated in a Survey or other activity on the Site
                within 30 days from your initial registration or within any 90-day period. Infosecmarketinsights will
                not provide you with any notice of the cancellation and forfeiture of any of your Points.
                Infosecmarketinsights reserves the right to amend these cancellation and forfeiture rules in its sole
                discretion.

                4. Suspension of Account; Cancellation Account: Your Account can also be suspended if one of the
                following situations arises:
                - No participation after you have joined the Panel
                - No participation in a Survey within your first 30 days in the Panel
                - No participation in a Survey within any 90-day period
                If your Account has been suspended or closed, you have the right to ask Infosecmarketinsights to
                investigate the situation. You should contact our Support team for that. If you feel your account has
                been incorrectly suspended or closed, you must contact Infosecmarketinsights by email within sixty (60)
                days following the alleged error and explain in full the basis of your dispute, attaching any relevant
                information which offers evidence of the discrepancy. Upon receipt of your notice, we will investigate
                your claim and notify you of our decision within thirty (30) days. If we need additional time to decide
                your claim, we will notify you and will endeavor to render a decision as soon as reasonably practicable.
                Any decision by us with regard to such a claim will be final. You may cancel your account at any time by
                going to our Site in your account section and clicking on "cancel my account," and your account will
                immediately be canceled. If you have any issues canceling your account, please contact the support team.
                The support team will respond to you as soon as reasonably practicable. Immediately upon deletion or
                your withdrawal from the Panel, your account will be closed. You understand and agree that, as noted
                above, upon suspension, cancellation, or closing of your account, your right to access the Services will
                cease, and all Points credited to your account at such time, however and whenever accumulated, will be
                forfeited. Infosecmarketinsights may terminate your account at any time for any reason.

                to reflect any such changes.

                your compliance with this Agreement and with all policies and guidelines applicable to the Services that

                deny redemption of Points, or restrict, block, limit, and prevent your access to and use of the
                Services, and further, all Points, incentives, and rewards shall be subject to forfeiture. Without
