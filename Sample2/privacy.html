                Lightspeed Privacy Policy
                Last updated: September 23rd, 2020



                1. Introduction


                This Privacy Policy sets out the commitment of Lightspeed LLC, 3 World Trade Center, 175 Greenwich St,
                35th Floor, New York, NY 10007, USA and its affiliates including Lightspeed Research Limited, 6 More
                London Place, London, SE1 2QY, UK (altogether "Lightspeed"), a Kantar group company ("Kantar"), to the
                privacy of its panel members (“Panellists”, “Panellist”), and governs Panellists’ rights regarding
                privacy and data protection.

                This Privacy Policy applies to the Lightspeed panels known as Infosecmarketinsights and All Global Circle,
                altogether identified in this Privacy Policy as the Lightspeed panels (the “Panels”). For clarity, this
                policy is publicly available on the Infosecmarketinsights panel site as “Infosecmarketinsights Panel Privacy Policy” and on
                the All Global Circle as “All Global Circle Privacy Policy”. Panellists are members of the Panels,
                operated by Lightspeed and for which Lightspeed is the data controller. Taking part in our panels,
                surveys and research activities is entirely voluntary. By registering to the Panels and accepting these
                terms, you confirm that you have read and understood the terms of this Privacy Policy. We ask you to
                read this Privacy Policy carefully.

                For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information which relates to an
                identifiable living individual (or the equivalent applicable term in your jurisdiction - for example in
                California, personal information would also relate to a specific household).



                2. Lawful Collection and Use of Data


                We collect your personal data in several ways such as through our website(s) (for example your panel
                portal), our mobile applications and other activities such as social media, apps and online, face to
                face or telephone studies or other research activities. We may add other ways and activities moving
                forward but we will always operate in compliance with this policy.

                We have set out below, more detailed information about how we use your personal data. We are also
                required by law to explain the legal basis for processing your personal data. These legal bases are
                listed below and could be different for each use case:

                we have your consent for the use of your personal data;
                we need to use your personal data in order to perform a contract with you;
                we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation;
                we need to process your data in order to protect your vital interests or someone else;
                the processing is necessary to perform a task in the public interest; or
                the use of your personal data is necessary for our (or our clients’) legitimate interests (in which case
                we will explain what those interests are).
                We will never misrepresent ourselves or what we are doing. If you receive an email that concerns you,
                purporting to be from us, please let us know as shown below in “How to Contact Us”.

                PURPOSE

                When you participate in our surveys, we typically use a temporary ID which makes your answers in the
                survey anonymous to our clients. However, some of our clients have the specific research design need to
                understand how your opinion has evolved over a period of time. For this specific project type that we
                call "tracking" projects we will use persistent IDs and we will make this clear at the beginning of each
                of these surveys. Your survey responses will be considered as personal data and you will have the right
                to access them. Such projects will contain a notice on the very first page of the survey, so that you
                can identify them and decide whether or not to take part

                DATA MATCHING AND ENRICHMENT

                PURPOSE

                We enrich the data we hold on file about you by matching your personal data with third parties. This
                will help us to improve your panel profile and ensure that we select relevant surveys for you.

                We utilize matching services (i.e. third parties who are specialized in data management) to acquire
                additional information about you from public and private data sources (such as social networks,
                retailers and content subscription services with whom you have an account) or to use your personal data
                as an aid to develop additional or new types of anonymous data sets (i.e. we compile your aggregate data
                with data from other consumers to create a new lifestyle segment). The matching service (our data
                partner) holds the personal data we share for a short time, uses it to assemble the additional
                information, and then returns the combined information to us. Data partners are contractually bound to
                delete the data we share with them and/or are not authorised to use it in any way other than for this
                specific purpose.

                DATA COLLECTED/PROCESSED

                Persistent unique identifier, contact details, email address, social login, cookie, mobile device ID,
                official identification number (i.e. ME number)


                SOURCE

                We obtain this data from you directly or combined with other secondary database

                ADVERTISING TARGETING AND MEDIA BUYING RESEARCH

                PURPOSE

                We use your personal data to help our clients and data partners enrich their data by using lookalike
                modelling techniques.

                Thanks to your participation in our surveys and your profile data, we can help our clients to improve
                their advertising targeting, and to create better online advertising models, through lookalike modelling
                or similar research methodologies. We will use your personal data we collect about you through profile
                building, participation in research surveys or data matching to match with third-parties and platforms
                (our data partners).

                We include contractual safeguards to ensure that you will not automatically be targeted for commercial
                purposes, as a result of your data being used to help create a lookalike audience, and that our data
                partners cannot use your data for any other purpose.

                DATA COLLECTED/PROCESSED

                Persistent unique identifier, contact details, email address, social login, cookie, IP address, mobile
                device ID, official identification number (i.e. ME number)


                SOURCE

                We obtain this data from you directly or combined with other secondary database

                AD EXPOSURE AND MEASUREMENT

                PURPOSE

                In addition to cookie-based matching (which you can control and consent to via your panel account), we
                will use personal data you provide to us, such as an email address, in a direct matching process with
                third parties (i.e. our clients and publishers) to determine if you are a user of that service (such as
                social networks, websites, mobile apps) for advertising measurement research purposes. We will identify
                what advertisements you may have been exposed to on those sites and platforms and measure how brand
                attitudes or brand recall have impacted sales. The third parties that we work with are not permitted to
                use the data for any other purpose.

                DATA COLLECTED/PROCESSED

                Persistent unique identifier, contact details, email address, social login, cookie, IP address, mobile
                device ID, official identification number (i.e. ME number)


                SOURCE

                We obtain this data from you directly or combined with other secondary database



                3. Third Parties (Clients and Suppliers)
                We may share your personal data with our third-party vendors and processors to perform panel management
                related activities in order to deliver panel services and activities to you. This could include vendors
                managing or assisting us in managing our panel databases, marketing automation and CRM, quality checks
                and fraud prevention, incentive management, and customer care. Some vendors will specifically work with
                us on enriching your panel profile, allowing us to select you for surveys, such as vendors specialized
                in, but not limited to, data matching, online ad effectiveness measurement, and social media data
                interactions. Categories of personal data shared with these vendors would typically be, but may not be
                limited to, name, email address, postal address, phone number, cookie ID, panelist ID, and IP address.
                Your personal data is not sold to third parties.

                Our third-party data partners and publishers are all contractually bound to keep any information they
                collect and disclose to us, or that we collect and disclose to them, confidential and must protect it
                with security standards and practices that are equivalent to our own.



                4. Confidentiality, Security and Industry Requirements and Where We Store Your Personal Data
                We take appropriate technological and organisational measures to protect your personal data, both during
                transmission and once we receive it. Our security procedures are consistent with generally accepted
                standards used to protect personal data.

                The data that we collect from you may be transferred to and/or stored outside your territory. It may
                also be processed by staff operating outside your territory who work for us or for one of our suppliers.
                If your personal data is transferred to, stored at or otherwise processed outside your country or
                territory, and that country or territory has not been recognized as providing an adequate level of data
                protection, we will put in place additional safeguards to protect your personal data, as required by
                applicable law. For example, if you are in the EEA, standard contractual clauses would be used if we
                process your data outside the EEA.

                Your account information and personal data are password protected so that you and only you have access
                to your information. In order to keep your personal data safe, we recommend that you do not divulge your
                password to anyone. Lightspeed will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in
                an unsolicited email. Also, please remember to sign out of your Panels account and close your browser
                window when you have finished visiting our site. This is to ensure that others cannot access your
                personal data and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a
                public place like a library or Internet cafe. Please change your password regularly.

                6. Cookie Disclosure


                Cookies are small text files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website that assigns a
                numerical user ID and stores certain information about your online browsing. They are used to help users
                navigate websites efficiently and perform certain functions. The website sends information to the
                browser, which then creates a text file on the user’s computer or mobile device. Every time the user
                goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website's server.

                For behavioural tracking research, we use optional cookies / software applications, but only if you have
                given your consent to these cookies / applications.

                As is true of most online surveys, we gather certain information automatically and store it in survey
                data files. This information may include the following: Internet Protocol addresses (IP address),
                browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”); referring/exit pages, operating system and date/time
                stamp.

                We use this automatically collected information to analyse trends such as browser usage and to
                administer the site, e.g. to optimise the survey experience depending on your browser type. We may also
                use your IP address to check whether there have been multiple participations in the survey from this IP
                address and to protect our business against fraudulent behaviour.

                Lightspeed defines cookies within 3 categories:

                Required to use the Panels site;
                Security-specific and
                Behavioural or advertising research cookies.
                For more information, please log in and access your cookie preferences page where you are able to adjust
                your cookie settings.



                7. Accuracy


                We take reasonable steps to keep personal data in our possession or control accurate, complete and
                current, based on the most recent information made available to us by you and/or by our client.

                We rely on you to help us keep your personal data accurate, complete and current by answering our
                questions honestly. You are responsible for ensuring that you notify us of any changes to your personal
                data.



                8. Children’s Data


                Lightspeed recognizes the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal data
                collected from children. We never knowingly invite children under the legal age set by the authorities
                in the country in which you reside to participate in research studies without parental permission. If it
                is necessary and appropriate to a particular project to directly involve children under the legal age,
                we take measures to ensure we have been obtained permission by a parent and/or legal guardian.
                Lightspeed will provide parents and/or a legal guardian information about the survey topic, any personal
                or sensitive information which may be collected from the children, the way the data will be used and
                whether and with whom Lightspeed may share such information. We do not sell children’s personal data.

                While the child is completing the survey, it is the responsibility of the parent and/or guardian to
                supervise them.

                From time to time, Lightspeed may collect personal data that is classified as “special categories” of
                personal data. This includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
                beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying
                a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual
                orientation. You can always choose whether to provide this data to us.

                Lightspeed is not responsible for the actions taken by these third parties to answer your request. You
                may be able to access your personal data held by these third parties and correct, amend or delete it
